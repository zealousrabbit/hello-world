**HELLO**

My name is Hannah. I am a resident of Lexington, Kentucky and I am new to coding. I have:

- two beautiful, spoiled rabbits
- many plants that I am trying to keep alive despite their best efforts
- 4 cabinets full of Biscoff cookies
- too many Hawaiian shirts

The top 5 most important things in my life are:

1) Steamed dumplings
2) Fried dumplings
3) Shrimp Shumai
4) Other types of carb-covered meats and veggies
5) My friends and family

I am looking forward to this class.

_Thank You_
